Insertion sort follows a special rule that is true at *three* points in the lifetime of the algorithm: 
Initialization: The rule applies before the first iteration
Maintenance: The rule holds true between iterations
Termination: The rule holds true after the last iteration as well.
What is this rule? At the start of each iteration, the subarray A[0: i - 1] is sorted. 
This is called the ‘Loop Invariant’, proves correctness of algorithm (like mathematical induction).
