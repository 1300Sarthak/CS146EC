This would be a useful property because stability is very important when sorting data when looking for 
different things. For example if we sort a list of employees first by their department and then by their
names, a stable sorter like Merge sort makes sure that within each department the employees' names remain 
in the original order. It doesn't hold well when trying to use Quick Sort, simply due to it being so unstable. 
The original order of elements is not guaranteed to be saved. This can lead to problems in which the sequence
of elements carries meaning or is significant
