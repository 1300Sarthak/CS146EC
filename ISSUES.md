## ISSUES

When making issues, you are trying to bring attention to problems with content that already exists on the repo. 

You need to follow the exact same naming convention for your issue titles, as your pull requests:

So, if you're submitting an issue with the Java Implementation for HW1, your pull request title should look like:

[HW][HW1] - Java Bruteforce Solution Will Not Compile - [Anant Shukla]

For an extra credit assignment, you could do something like 

[EC][Structuring Our Thoughts] - Java Bruteforce Solution Will Not Compile - [Anant Shukla]

For a lab assignment, you could do something like 

[LABS][LAB1] - Java Bruteforce Solution Will Not Compile - [Anant Shukla]

For notes, you could do something like 

[NOTES] - Structuring our thoughts lecture notes have errors - [Anant Shukla]


If you do not follow these conventions, I probably won't look at your issue, so do be careful!


YOU MAY WISH TO CREATE A PULL REQUEST THAT FIXES THIS ISSUE. If so, create that pull request, and put a link to that PR in the issue. If your issue is valid, and your fix works, you'll get 2 counts of extra credit instead of just 1!

## ENHANCEMENTS

Things you want that aren't a problem with the existing repo, should be labeled enhancements. 

Create an issue with the [ENHANCEMENT] tag and I'll understand what you're trying to do. 

For example, if you wished for a new category for submissions called "Underwater Basketweaving", you want to have an issue title like

[ENHANCEMENT] Add underwater basketweaving category

In the issue body, explain why underwater basketweaving is the best thing ever, and how it helps you prepare for the final
