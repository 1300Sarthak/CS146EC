Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

For this lab, we will change the definition of a BST slightly, for simplicity: 

   -The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
   -The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Remember, this property should apply to all subtrees as well.
