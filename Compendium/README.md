This is the "Compendium", a sorta wiki-like collection of all of the concepts covered in the CS 146 - Data Structures and Algorithms course with Professor Anant Shukla. This is meant not only to be referred back to for the context of studying in the final, but created to be helpful to refer back to in other classes and non-academic settings where appropriate. As such, it is sorted not by when we covered the topics, but by the actual topic. 

Feedback, additions, and corrections are encouraged as this is a fairly deep undertaking for one person (me) to complete in a timely manner, although please try and stick to the slides for information (as that is what is most imperative to know), although adding pictures and minutae from other sources is also acceptable if it aids in understanding of the main content.
