### How to earn extra credit

You want to contribute *meaningfully* to this repository to earn extra credit. Each contribution is worth the same as submitting to an extra credit assignment in class. 

Ensure that your contibutions follow the [Contribution Guidelines](contributing.md). If they don't, I won't merge your pull requests, and someone else might be able to steal all your hard work!

### What counts for extra credit
Every subfolder you see is one potential area to earn extra credit. 

1. #### Homework
    a. Java Solution
    b. Python Solution 
    c. Pseudocode
    d. Plain English Approach (This should match the Java/Python solutions)

2. #### Labs
    a. Java Solution
    b. Python Solution 
    c. Pseudocode
    d. Plain English Approach (This should match the Java/Python solutions)

3. #### Extra Credit
    a. Java Solution
    b. Python Solution 
    c. Pseudocode
    d. Plain English Approach (This should match the Java/Python solutions)

    Obviously, each extra credit problem may not need all of these, since some asked for a plain text submission. Exercise your judgement, you are all smart enough to understand what is needed for each problem!

4. #### Notes

    If you have maintained notes that are legible and actually helpful for people besides yourself, you may want to submit them here. Text/ Markdown works best, since making modifications/corrections is easier, but PDFs work too, if that's what you have. 

5. #### Issues

    See some code that will never execute? Some statements that are flat out wrong? Create an issue! If it's a valid concern, I will approve it. Ideally, if you saw the issue, you should also propose a fix. If you're too lazy to that, someone else can always fix it for extra credit. Make sure you follow the [Issue Guidelines](issues.md)

6. #### Enhancements

    Really wish there was an extra subfolder for something? Think there's a better way to do things? Create an issue! More details under [Issue Guidelines](issues.md).

### Style guides

Clean code is always better to work with. I don't care about whether you prefer 2-space tabs or 4, but I do care that you have some sort of structured approach as to how you structure your code. 

You may wish to look at:

1. The [Java style guide by Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
2. The [Pep 8 guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for python. 

There are many other sources, so feel free to explore and experiment. Thumb rule to think about when styling: Will my professor be happy or annoyed looking through the code I've submitted? 


### FAQs

1. I submitted a pull request for something, but somebody already submitted the same thing. What happens now?
-  Whichever pull request was created first will be accepted for extra credit.
