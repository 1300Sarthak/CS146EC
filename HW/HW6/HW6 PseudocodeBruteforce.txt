threeSum(nums)
    initialize triplets as an empty list
    sort nums
    for i from 0 to length of nums
        for j from i + 1 to length of nums
            for k from j + 1 to length of nums
                if (sum of nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] equals 0) and (triplets does not contain that sum)
                    add [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] to triplets
    return triplets
